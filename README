Rice Leaf Disease Detection Code
This repository contains code for rice leaf disease detection using popular deep learning models such as ResNet-50,
VGG19, InceptionV3, and Vision Transformer. The goal of this project is to develop accurate and efficient models
for detecting rice leaf diseases in images.

Included Models
1. ResNet-50
ResNet-50, renowned for its residual network architecture, is employed in this project for its superior image classification
capabilities. Utilizing transfer learning, the model is fine-tuned specifically for the task of rice leaf diseases detection.

2. VGG19
VGG19, a convolutional neural network architecture recognized for its effectiveness in image recognition, is incorporated into
this project. The pre-trained VGG19 model is adapted and fine-tuned for precise rice leaf diseases detection.

3. InceptionV3
InceptionV3, balancing accuracy and computational efficiency, is integrated into the repository. Leveraging transfer learning, 
the pre-trained InceptionV3 model is customized for accurate rice leaf diseases detection.

4. Vision Transformer (ViT)
The Vision Transformer (ViT), based on transformer architecture, has exhibited success in image classification. This repository 
includes code for applying and fine-tuning ViT for the specific task of rice leaf diseases detection.
